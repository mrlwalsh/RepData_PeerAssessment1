# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Setup  

Set the working directory, check and set directories, check and load packages,
load libraries.  
```{r}
setwd("~/GitHub/RepData_PeerAssessment1")

# check for directories and create if needed
if (!file.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

if (!file.exists("figures")) {
  dir.create("figures")
}

# Check and load packages

install_required_libs<-function() {
    for(i in 1:length(required_lib)) {
        if(required_lib[i] %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {
            install.packages(required_lib[i])                            }
        library(required_lib[i], character.only = TRUE)
                                     }
                                  }

required_lib =c("ggplot2","ggvis","dplyr")

install_required_libs()

```
## Loading and preprocessing the data

* Show any code that is needed to Load the data (i.e. read.csv())  

* Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis  

```{r}
a_data <- read.csv(file="./data/activity.csv",header=TRUE,fill=TRUE)

str(a_data)
summary(a_data)

# transform data

a_data$date <- as.Date(a_data$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
summary(a_data)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?  

For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the  
dataset.  

* Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day  

* Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day  

```{r}
# Use dplyr and ggvis to group and display histogram of total steps
# steps <- 
# a_data %>%
#   group_by(date) %>%
#   summarize(nsteps = sum(steps)) %>%
#   ggvis(~nsteps) %>%
#   layer_histograms(binwidth = 1000) %>%
#   add_axis("x", title = "Number of Steps Taken") %>%
#   add_axis("x", orient = "top", ticks = 0, title = "Histogram of Steps Taken per Day",
#            properties = axis_props(
#              axis = list(stroke = "white"),
#              labels = list(fontSize = 0)))
# 
# steps

steps_plot <-
a_data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(nsteps = sum(steps)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=nsteps)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000)

steps_plot + labs(title="Number of Steps per Day", x= "Number of Steps")

#Place plot in figures directory

png(file = "./figures/rrpa1_hist1.png")

steps_plot <-
a_data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(nsteps = sum(steps)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=nsteps)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title="Number of Steps per Day", x= "Number of Steps")

steps_plot

dev.off()

# group data by day summing steps
meansteps <-
    a_data %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarize(nsteps = sum(steps))

# find mean and median number of steps by day
meansteps
ms <- mean(meansteps$nsteps,na.rm=TRUE)
med <- median(meansteps$nsteps,na.rm=TRUE)

ms
med
    
```
The mean number of steps taken per day is **`r as.integer(ms)`** and the median 
number of steps taken per day is **`r med`**.  

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis)  
and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)  

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset,  
contains the maximum number of steps?  
```{r}

# Find and remove NA rows

sum(is.na(a_data))

for (i in 1:ncol(a_data)) {
  print(names(a_data)[i]);print(sum(is.na(a_data[,i])))
}

bad_steps <- is.na(a_data$steps)
ga_data <- a_data[!bad_steps,]

summary(a_data)
summary(ga_data)

# inter <-
#     ga_data %>%
#     group_by(interval) %>%
#     summarize(avgsteps = mean(steps)) %>%
#     ggvis(~interval,~avgsteps) %>%
#     layer_paths()
# 
# inter

# Plot time series avgsteps by interval

inter_ggp <-
    ga_data %>%
    group_by(interval) %>%
    summarize(avgsteps = mean(steps)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=interval,y=avgsteps)) +
           geom_line() +
           scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2400, by = 200)) +
           labs(title="Time Series of Average Steps over Interval", 
                x= "Intra Day Interval")

inter_ggp

# Save Plot to figures dirtectory

png(file = "./figures/rrpa1_interval.png")

inter_ggp <-
    ga_data %>%
    group_by(interval) %>%
    summarize(avgsteps = mean(steps)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=interval,y=avgsteps)) +
           geom_line() +
           scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2400, by = 200)) +
           labs(title="Time Series of Average Steps over Interval", 
                x= "Intra Day Interval")

inter_ggp

dev.off()

# order avgstep by interval data from High to Low

inter1 <-
    ga_data %>%
    group_by(interval) %>%
    summarize(avgsteps = mean(steps)) %>%
    arrange(desc(avgsteps))

inter1

inter1$interval[1]
inter1$avgsteps[1]

# inter2 <-
#     ga_data %>%
#     group_by(interval) %>%
#     summarize(avgsteps = mean(steps)) %>%
#     filter(interval >= 750 & interval <= 850) %>%
#     ggvis(~interval,~avgsteps) %>%
#     layer_paths()
# 
# inter2

```
Interval **`r inter1$interval[1]`** has **`r as.integer(inter1$avgsteps[1])`** average
steps, the maximun average number of steps.

## Imputing missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values  
(coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some  
calculations or summaries of the data. 

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset  
(i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)  

Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.  
The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use  
the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.  

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the  
missing data filled in.  

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate  
and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these  
values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What  
is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily  
number of steps?  

#### Strategy for Replacing NA Values  

The better approach for replacing missing step data is to use the average for
each interval across all days.  The range of step values seems to be narrower
for each interval across all days than for each day across all intervals.  I am
using the average of each interval across all days to replace missing step data
in the dataframe.  


```{r}

#Find missing data values
sum(is.na(a_data))

for (i in 1:ncol(a_data)) {
  print(names(a_data)[i]);print(sum(is.na(a_data[,i])))
}

bad_steps <- is.na(a_data$steps)
ba_data <- a_data[bad_steps,]

nrow(ba_data)

# Use left join of original activity dataframe with interval averages data frame
tt <- left_join(a_data, inter1)

head(tt)
tail(tt)

tt$avgsteps <- as.integer(tt$avgsteps)

head(tt)
tail(tt)

ttt <- is.na(tt$steps)

# Replace NA state values with average across intervals
tt$steps[is.na(tt$steps)] <- tt$avgsteps

head(tt)
tail(tt)

summary(tt)

# Plot histogram with missing values replaced with averages
steps_plot_revised <-
tt %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(nsteps = sum(steps)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=nsteps)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000)

         
steps_plot_revised + labs(title="Number of Steps per Day", x= "Number of Steps")

png(file = "./figures/rrpa1_hist1_rev.png")

steps_plot_revised <-
tt %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(nsteps = sum(steps)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=nsteps)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title="Number of Steps per Day", x= "Number of Steps")

steps_plot_revised

dev.off()

# group data by day summing steps
meansteps_revised <-
    tt %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarize(nsteps = sum(steps))

# find mean and median number of steps by day
# meansteps

ms_rev <- mean(meansteps_revised$nsteps,na.rm=TRUE)
med_rev <- median(meansteps_revised$nsteps,na.rm=TRUE)

ms_rev
med_rev
```
The mean number of steps taken per day is **`r as.integer(ms_rev)`** and the median 
number of steps taken per day is **`r med_rev`**, after replacing missing values
for steps with the average number of steps for each interval.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the  
dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.  

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and  
"weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.  

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the  
5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged  
across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look  
something like the following, which was creating using simulated data:  

![Sample panel plot](figures/sample_plot_1.png)

Your plot will look different from the one above because you will be using the  
activity monitor data. Note that the above plot was made using the lattice  
system but you can make the same version of the plot using any plotting system  
you choose.

```{r}

inter_by_day_type <-
    tt %>%
    mutate(day_name = weekdays(date),
           day_type = ifelse(day_name == "Saturday" | 
                             day_name == "Sunday","Weekend","Weekday")) %>%
    group_by(interval,day_type) %>%
    summarize(avgsteps_day = mean(steps)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=interval,y=avgsteps_day)) +
           geom_line() +
           facet_grid(day_type ~ .) +
           scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2400, by = 200)) +
           labs(title="Time Series of Average Steps over Interval", 
                x= "Intra Day Interval")

inter_by_day_type

png(file = "./figures/rrpa1_ts_day_type.png")

inter_by_day_type <-
    tt %>%
    mutate(day_name = weekdays(date),
           day_type = ifelse(day_name == "Saturday" | 
                             day_name == "Sunday","Weekend","Weekday")) %>%
    group_by(interval,day_type) %>%
    summarize(avgsteps_day = mean(steps)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=interval,y=avgsteps_day)) +
           geom_line() +
           facet_grid(day_type ~ .) +
           scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2400, by = 200)) +
           labs(title="Time Series of Average Steps over Interval", 
                x= "Intra Day Interval")

inter_by_day_type


dev.off()
```
The panel plot does show differences in the time series of steps on weekdays
versus weekends.
